	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h4 style="color:white">I am indifferent to movies most of the time since I might be too picky and busy. For entertainment media, including movies, music, games, et certera, I prefer the ones that grabs my attention and creates its own universe. I watched The Matrix for a school project and out of recommandation and I have to admit that it is the most mesmorizing one
	that I have ever watched. The amount of effort in the effects and the storyline truely deserves the fame it received. The logic in the movie is innovative and almost flawless, creating the kind of universe you want to be a part of but do not dare to enter.</h4>

		<h4 style="color:white">It's hard for me to say who is my favorite, but I will go with Keanu Reeves since I see most character development in his character.</h4>
